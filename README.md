# Survomatic 1.4.0 for R12.2.1 on Windows
This repository includes R package Survomatic 1.4.0 and its dependencies for Windows.

*Disclaimer: I'm not the developer of any of the packages hosted in this repository. The purpose of the repository is to make Survomatic 1.4.0 available and to facilitate running it on a local Windows machine. Due to the age of the package and its needed dependencies, not all necessary Windows binaries are available for download (only tar.gz are archived). This repository eliminates the need to collect and compile binaries from archived tar.gz package files.*

A local Windows installation of R12.2.1 is needed (download here: https://cran-archive.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/old/2.12.1/).
Download file Survomatic1.4.0_complete.zip, unzip and place package folders directly in your R12.2.1 library. Command <code>.libPaths()</code>, executed in R12.2.1, gives you the local path for your R12.2.1 library.

The manual for Survomatic 1.4.0 (Survomatic1.4.Manual.pdf) is also included in file Survomatic1.4.0_complete.zip.

Happy parametric hazard modelling!
